# EF-assessment

In the previous work: , we proposed the effect size, especially Cohen's d, as a feature selection method. The taraget of the work is to use this novel method to select 
the best relevant features to diagnose breast cancer. Since Cohen's d is useful to measure the association significance of two normal distributions, the main
idea is to measure the variable importance by measuring the association between the variable distribution for the benign sample (Class B) and the malignant sample (Class M). 

## Breast cancer

Breast cancer is the most deadly cancer in the world that affects the milk-conducts. According to the World Health Organization in 2022, breast cancer was diagnosed to over

cancerous cell, and grows until the fifth phase, spreading the cancer to other body parts.
